Here's a list of more or less useful tools that I've created over the years.
This is just a selection of stuff I have hosted on ~GitHub~. In no particular
order:

* [[https://github.com/myme/dotfiles][dotfiles]]

These are my dotfiles. There are many like them, but these ones are mine. I
take my dotfiles very seriously, as any professional programmer should.

* [[https://github.com/myme/myme.no][myme.no]]

The source code for this very website. A statically generated site using [[https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/][Hakyll]]
to generate the static assets and [[https://nixos.org/][Nix]] for building.

* [[https://github.com/myme/nixon][nixon]] (Haskell)

Project environment and command launcher using [[https://github.com/junegunn/fzf][fzf]] or [[https://github.com/davatorium/rofi][rofi]] for fuzzy selection.

* [[https://github.com/myme/rtcp][rtcp]] (JavaScript + Haskell)

Exchange stuff (text) between things (browsers) using ~WebRTC~.

* [[https://github.com/myme/aoc][Advent of Code]] (Haskell + Rust)

Solutions for various years of [[https://adventofcode.com/][Advent of Code]].

* [[https://github.com/myme/piddif][Piddif]] (Haskell)

A document renderer supporting different formats, outputting HTML ready to print
from a browser. Created because I *know* how to style ~HTML~ using ~CSS~, and I
*don't* know how to style ~LaTeX~. Uses [[https://pandoc.org/][Pandoc]].

* [[https://github.com/myme/annodate][Annodate]] (Haskell)

A tiny, simple *nix tool to prepend (customizable) timestamps to input streams.

* [[https://github.com/cisco-ce/jsxapi][JSXAPI]] (JavaScript)

JavaScript language binding library for Cisco's Webex collaboration devices.
Proprietary software turned open-source. In "widespread" use.

* [[https://github.com/myme/Snake][Snake]] (C)

Stupid ~C~ (with ~ncurses~) implementation of the everhungry Snake game.

* [[https://github.com/myme/elvis][Elvis]] (JavaScript)

A library for creating DOM elements with a JavaScript-friendly API. Quite
similar to, and superseeded by [[https://github.com/hyperhype/hyperscript][Hyperscript]].
