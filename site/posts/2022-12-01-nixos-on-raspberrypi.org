Hardware come and hardware go. About one year ago I [[file:2021-11-25-nixos-home-assistant.org][moved my Home Manager setup]]
from a ~Raspberry PI 3 Model B~ to an ~Intel NUC Core i3~. After that migration
my poor Raspberry Pi has been laying on a shelf, collecting dust.

Even a decommissioned Raspberry Pi could have some utility running on the home
network. With some time to spare, last weekend seemed like [[https://mastodon.social/@myme/109361279550675260][the weekend for
building RPi images]]. To get going quickly it's possible to download [[https://hydra.nixos.org/job/nixos/release-22.05/nixos.sd_image.aarch64-linux][pre-built
NixOS SD card images]] from [[https://hydra.nixos.org][Hydra]]. Guaranteed to save me a lot of time, that was
naturally not the path I chose. I wanted to build the image and machine
configuration myself, because why not[fn:1].

[fn:1] Actually there is a great benefit in building SD images yourself. As the
post later goes on to explain, it's possible to build your entire ~NixOS~
configuration and flash it to an SD card from a much more powerful computer.
This allows to sidestep any building or installation process on the resource
limited Raspberry Pi.

* Building

The Raspberry Pi is quite a limited system when it comes to computing resources
and you don't really want to find yourself building much to any software on it
natively. Instead it would be great to save some grief by building the
configuration on a more powerful machine.

The configuration required to build a ~NixOS~ SD card image for the Raspberry Pi
turned out to be really short and sweet. Here's a minimal ~nixosConfigurations~
entry where a system configuration includes the necessary module to build SD
card ISO images:

#+begin_src nix
{
  description = "NixOS Raspberry Pi configuration flake";
  outputs = { self, nixpkgs }: {
    nixosConfigurations.rpi = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      system = "aarch64-linux";
      modules = [
        "${nixpkgs}/nixos/modules/installer/sd-card/sd-image-aarch64.nix"
        { config.system.stateVersion = "22.05"; }
      ];
    };
  };
}
#+end_src

#+begin_note
I pretty much exclusively use ~nix flakes~ these days. The configuration above,
as its description hints at, is a flake. This doesn't mean that building ~NixOS~
for Raspberry Pi cannot be done without flakes. I will only include flake
instructions in this post because I haven't tried the alternatives.

I included a "crash course", if you will, in flakes in [[file:2022-01-16-nixos-the-ultimate-dev-environment.org::*Nix Flakes][NixOS: The Ultimate Dev
Environment?]], but there are several [[https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-05-25-flakes/][introductions to flakes]] popping up in
[[https://xeiaso.net/blog/series/nix-flakes][blogs]] and [[https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes][wikis]].
#+end_note

In fact, these days I frequently find things I would assume to be "tricky",
"advanced" or "hacky" on other distros to be really elegant on ~NixOS~. I've
come to conclude that not only is ~NixOS~ awesome because of how its
declarative, pure and composable nature result in highly reproducible builds and
configurations, but more often than not people have managed to hide complex
tasks behind elegant abstractions. I'm sure it's a combination of the
environment enabling and encouraging the smart people working on ~NixOS~ to
easily build simple interfaces.

And on the flip side of that, [[file:2020-01-26-nixos-for-development.org::*Arrested development][I have full sympathy]] for all beginners to ~nix~,
clawing their way up the rocky cliff towards the fabled lighthouse of hope of
eternal declarative reproducible software bliss.

** The SD image attribute path

The SD card image derivation can be found under the following property in the
flake configuration hierarchy:

#+begin_src nix
nixosConfigurations.rpi.config.system.build.sdImage
#+end_src

While creating this configuration is trivial, chances are building it is not as
simple as invoking:

#+begin_src bash
nix build .#nixosConfigurations.rpi.config.system.build.sdImage
#+end_src

Most likely - depending on your build machine's architecture - ~nix~ will greet
you with an error message similar to the following[fn:2]:

#+begin_example
error: a 'aarch64-linux' with features {} is required to build
    '/nix/store/m9l1cvifh44nl7fscp7mjbl7qv88478g-stage-2-init.sh.drv',
    but I am a 'x86_64-linux' with features {benchmark, big-parallel, kvm, nixos-test}
#+end_example

[fn:2] Newlines added for readability.

** Cross-compiling

#+begin_note
This section reached a dead end for the time being. Skip on to [[#registering-qemu-emulation-as-a-binfmt-wrapper][the next section]]
if this isn't relevant to you.
#+end_note

The Raspberry Pi 3 is an ~ARM~ chip, requiring binaries targeting ~aarch64~. As
with the full SD image ~NixOS Hydra~ builds ~nixpkgs~ for ~aarch64-linux~ (and
Apple ~aarch64-darwin~). The binary cache on [[https://cache.nixos.org][cache.nixos.org]] helps greatly
speeding up the image generation as most stock derivations would be already
built.

I use ~x86_64~ machines exclusively (besides this one R-Pi). This poses the
challenge of cross-compilation if I want to build the R-Pi SD card image. There
are several options listed on [[https://nixos.wiki/wiki/NixOS_on_ARM#Build_your_own_image_natively][the NixOS wiki's ARM section]] for how to "natively"
build the images.

The NixOS Wiki has a brief section on how to do native cross compilation setting
~nixpkgs.crossSystem.system~ to ~aarch64-linux~. The ~nixpkgs~ sources for
~crossSystem~ states themselves, this is kind of a nonsensical settings. Why?
Because (pure, as in isolated builds) cross-compilation requires at least /two/
(or three) system architectures:

 1. The build host's architecture, on which the toolchain is built and run.
 2. The host machine's architecture, which is the target binary format of the
    build process and where the binaries will eventually run.
 3. The target machine's architecture, which is more related to toolchain build
    and compatibility.

Given this, the following snippet from the ~NixOS~ Wiki seems to be outdated and
didn't really work all that well:

#+begin_src nix
{ ... }: {
  nixpkgs.crossSystem.system = "aarch64-linux";
}
#+end_src

The resulting toolchain did not seem to provide proper ~NixOS~-style wrapped
binaries and several toolchain paths (like typical system includes) and linker
paths were broken.

Particularly, with flakes, the build (local) machine architecture shouldn't be
inferred from the system for the sake of purity. Rather, what seemed to have a
lot more success in kicking off the (native) cross-compilation build of the SD
card image was the following ~nixpkgs~ settings:

#+begin_src nix
{ ... }: {
  nixpkgs.buildPlatform.system = "x86_64-linux";
  nixpkgs.hostPlatform.system = "aarch64-linux";
}
#+end_src

This resulted in better cache hits from the NixOS cache and many packages
started building, saturating my machine's CPUs with parallel builds. Sweet!

Unfortunately, while the cross-compilation of the ~aarch64~ Linux kernel purred
away through the build, the simultaneous build of ~samba~ failed due to missing
headers. I did spent a wee bit of time trying to figure out why the ~#ifdef~
including ~crypt.h~ was set when ~waf~ listed it as missing in the configure
step, but eventually I didn't want to spend more time than necessary on this yak
shave:

#+begin_example
error: builder for '/nix/store/khs4kyxqa7gkd6wvg467d6a5s084zb7p-samba-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu-4.15.9.drv' failed with exit code 1;

#+end_example

In the end the native cross-compilation was looking promising, but at the end of
the day I left it at that.

** Registering ~QEmu~ emulation as a ~binfmt~ wrapper

As an alternative to native cross-compilation it's also possible to compile for
~aarch64~ registering ~QEmu~ emulation as a ~binfmt~ wrapper. This can easily be
done by adding this single definition to the build machine's ~NixOS~
configuration:

#+begin_src nix
{
  boot.binfmt.emulatedSystems = [ "aarch64-linux" ];
}
#+end_src

After a ~nixos-rebuild test~ the local machine should now be able to run
binaries built for ~aarch64~ and thus the tools required to build the ~NixOS~
configuration for the R-Pi SD images. I've tested this from both native ~NixOS~
on ~x86_64~ and on ~NixOS~ running in ~WSL~. Both worked great.

Now, one of the reasons for investing some effort into native cross-compilation
is that emulation is significantly slower than any native counterpart. As part
of my configuration I have e.g. some [[../projects.html][Haskell utlities]] that require compilation.
~Haskell~ isn't exactly known for its ludicrous compilation speeds and
overlooking the emulated ~GHC~ grind through each source file was like watching
paint dry.

** Customization

The image build from the configurations already shown will not contain any
customizations. It would be a stock ~NixOS~ image, identical to the installers
built by [[https://hydra.nixos.org/][Hydra]].

Wouldn't it be great if we could customize the configuration and have that
configuration be what we flash to the SD card without having to do any further
~nixos-rebuild~ commands after booting the R-Pi?

But of course, we're talking about ~NixOS~ here after all! Here's an incomplete
example configuration illustrating various "configuration points" within the
flake structure. The R-Pi image is basically nothing more special than a regular
~NixOS~ configuration, and thus it's possible to pull in any existing ~NixOS~
configuration or module into this config:

#+begin_src nix
{
  description = "NixOS Raspberry Pi configuration flake";
  outputs = { self, nixpkgs }: {
    nixosConfigurations.rpi = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      system = "aarch64-linux";
      modules = [
        # SD card image
        "${nixpkgs}/nixos/modules/installer/sd-card/sd-image-aarch64.nix"

        # Additional NixOS modules, like Home Manager or personal modules
        home-manager.nixosModules.home-manager
        ./some/presonal/module.nix

        # Inline configuration here
        ({ ... }: {
          config = {
            # ...like <hostname>
            networking.hostName = "bringebær-pai";
            system.stateVersion = "22.05";
          };
        })
      ];
    };
  };
}
#+end_src

In the case of my dotfiles I do have [[https://github.com/myme/dotfiles/blob/0177caaff52fe66adae6829871c861be6c894c1d/lib/makeNixOS.nix][some abstractions]] over
~nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem~ which builds configurations with some default modules
based on my dotfile repository structure. I gave a walkthrough of this
configuration in my previous post: [[file:2022-06-14-nixos-confederation.org][NixOS: Confederation]].

** C.mpr.ss..n

By default, the SD image ~ISO~ is /compressed/ using ~zstd~. This is a
reasonable default as it saves a significant amount of disk space:

#+begin_example
nix-repl> :lf .
Added 8 variables.

nix-repl> :p nixosConfigurations.rpi.config.system.build.sdImage.compressImage
true
#+end_example

The image can be decompressed using the following command:

#+begin_src sh
$ nix shell nixpkgs#zstd -c unzstd -o nixos.img ./result/sd-image/<name>.img.zst
#+end_src

** No compression

With all my customizations and additional tools the image size is considerably
bigger than the default. Expect that compressing the resulting ~.img~ using
~zstd~ takes quite a bit of time. Since I was intending on only building the SD
image once, I skipped the ~zstd~ by setting
~config.system.build.sdImage.compressImage = false~:

#+begin_src nix
{
  description = "NixOS Raspberry Pi configuration flake";
  outputs = { self, nixpkgs }: {
    nixosConfigurations.rpi = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      system = "aarch64-linux";
      modules = [
        "${nixpkgs}/nixos/modules/installer/sd-card/sd-image-aarch64.nix"
        {
          config = {
            system = {
              # Disable zstd compression
              build.sdImage.compressImage = false;

              # ... other configs

              stateVersion = "22.05";
            };
          };
        }
      ];
    };
  };
}
#+end_src

#+begin_note
If you're building many of these configurations with slight changes keep in mind
that each build will result in a complete new ~ISO~ image in the ~nix store~.
This will quickly exhaust your disk, so either keep compression ~on~ or make
sure to ~nix-collect-garbage~ on occasion.
#+end_note

Surely enough, in the end the SD image was built and ready to be flashed onto a
real SD card. Without concern of stripping down the configuration to bare
minimums my image containing all my headless customizations and tools take close
to ~9GB~ of disk space. A minimal installation ends up somewhere around ~2.5GB~.

#+begin_src sh
❯ ls -lh result/sd-image/
total 8.7G
-r--r--r-- 1 root root 8.7G Jan  1  1970 nixos-sd-image-22.11.20221031.d40fea9-aarch64-linux.img
#+end_src

* Flashing the SD card

After plugging the SD card into the build machine there are several ways to
figure out which device it ends up being assigned. Personally I just use ~dmesg~
or ~dmesg --follow~ for this, which provides some fairly obvious output:

#+begin_example
[1514026.420241] mmc0: new ultra high speed SDR50 SDHC card at address e624
[1514026.420557] mmcblk0: mmc0:e624 AALCD 29.7 GiB
[1514026.425039]  mmcblk0: p1 p2
#+end_example

This means that the SD card device to use in the following commands would be
~/dev/mmcblk0~.

#+begin_note
It's important to be 100% sure to find the correct device. Using the ~dd~
command it's notoriously simple to start copying bytes over to the wrong device
and rendering it useless, as a poor coworker of mine once had the displeasure of
experiencing.
#+end_note

One alternative to ~dmesg~ is to use ~lsblk~, for which I don't currently have
any example output containing the SD card:

#+begin_example
❯ lsblk
NAME           MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE  MOUNTPOINTS
nvme0n1        259:0    0 476.9G  0 disk
├─nvme0n1p1    259:1    0   511M  0 part  /boot
└─nvme0n1p2    259:2    0 476.4G  0 part
  └─root       254:0    0 476.4G  0 crypt
    ├─vg-swap  254:1    0    16G  0 lvm   [SWAP]
    └─vg-nixos 254:2    0 460.4G  0 lvm   /nix/store
                                          /
#+end_example

Having gathered all pieces of information it should now be time to copy over the
image to the SD card device. This can be done using the ~dd~ command, specifying
the SD card image as the ~if~ (input file) and the device path as the ~of~
(output file).

#+begin_src sh
sudo dd \
    if=result/sd-image/nixos-sd-image-22.11.20221031.d40fea9-aarch64-linux.img \
    of=/dev/mmcblk0 \
    status=progress \
    bs=4M
#+end_src

* Booting

** Power issues

The ~NixOS~ wiki warns about [[https://nixos.wiki/wiki/NixOS_on_ARM/Raspberry_Pi_3#Power_issues][power issues]] related specifically to the R-Pi 3:

#+begin_quote
Especially with the power-hungry Raspberry Pi 3, it is important to have a
sufficient enough power supply or weirdness may happen.
#+end_quote

And surely enough, /weirdness/ ensued.

I don't quite remember what I used to power the R-Pi previously, but this time
around I was using some regular USB adapters I had laying around. The R-Pi
seemed to start up exactly as it should and once I had the SD image ready I was
presented with the ~NixOS~ boot process and all seemed well. Power being an
issue wasn't in my mind at this point.

However, at some point during "Stage 2" of the boot process, everything went
black and the R-Pi eventually entered a cyclic boot. This seemed to consistently
happen right when the kernel changes or updates the framebuffer resolution
and/or fonts (or whatever happens with that regular boot-time "flicker"). For
the first couple of reboots I thought I might have mistakenly setup an X server
on my image, and now the X server was causing some panic or whatever right when
it was starting. Naturally my first though was that I had somehow messed up the
image and it was corrupt in one way or another. To eliminate personal fuckups my
first attempt at fixing this issue was to double check that one of the pre-built
images managed to get me to the login prompt.

No such luck.

The same blackout then reboot happened in exactly the same way with the
pre-built SD image. At this point I had spent quite a bit of time on this
project and was feeling tired. Building images, flashing SD cards and booting
Raspberry Pis has a long feedback loop, particularly with large images and slow
SD card bandwidths. Not knowing which wild goose to chase it killed my spirit to
push on. Better take a break!

A few days passed, but I eventually felt revigorated and came back with a fresh
mind. I started by re-reading the ~NixOS~ Wiki on Raspberry Pi, and surely
enough I was reminded of the importance of providing the R-Pi with sufficient,
stable power.

Switching out the random USB adapter with something capable of consistently
serving up to ~2A~ of ~5V~ seemed to get me to the long awaited login prompt on
~tty1~.

Great success! However, logging in I did not see my familiar [[https://starship.rs/][starship]] prompt,
but rather a more stock ~bash~ prompt reminding me that I pulled all my configs
from the SD image to rule out any personal settings messing up the boot process.

After another few iterations of rebuilding and reflashing the SD card -
eventually growing the image to a (not so modest) ~9 GB~ from the stripped down
~2.5 GB~ of the plain image - I was able to log in to a system that felt like
~$HOME~.

[[file:../images/nixos-on-raspberry-pi3.png]]

* Remote deployment

Building the SD card image with all our customizations and tweaks saved us a ton
of time. Once the R-Pi is up running we can't keep re-flashing the SD card
whenever we want to update our software. It's of course possible copy over the
configuration to the R-Pi, ~ssh~ in and issue ~nixos-rebuild switch~ there, but
building my configuration itself the Raspberry Pi wouldn't have finished by
Christmas.

It's much more desirable to keep using remote building and rather copy over all
the /store paths/ required for the new NixOS generation over to the R-Pi once
they're built. There are a few hurdles to overcome first before making that a
reality.

** Generating ~nix~ cache keys

In order for remote systems to accept derivations built on other machines they
have to be signed in the ~nix store~ of the build machine or through the ~nix~
cache server. Generating a key is quite simple, following the steps on
[[https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Distributed_build#Using_remote_builders_as_substituters][Distributed build]] or [[https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Binary_Cache][Binary Cache]] over at the [[https://nixos.wiki/wiki][NixOS Wiki]]:

#+begin_example
$ nix-store --generate-binary-cache-key builder-name cache-priv-key.pem cache-pub-key.pem
#+end_example

#+begin_note
This is using the "legacy"[fn:3] ~nix-store~ command. There might be an entry
into cache key generation using ~nix store~ or similar, but I have neither
looked nor stumbled over it.
#+end_note

Most people who've used ~nix~ for any significant time should be familiar with
seeing pre-built store paths pulled down from [[https://cache.nixos.org][cache.nixos.org]]. It's also
possible to use other caches (substitutors) like [[https://cachix.org][cachix]] or serving up a ~nix
store~ directly from the local machine using e.g. [[https://github.com/edolstra/nix-serve][nix-serve]] (or any of its many
compatible clones).

As a security mechanism ~nix~ doesn't allow using pre-built store paths from
random hosts. To ensure that a path has been built by a trusted remote ~nix~
allows signing store paths. By default, ~nix~ is configured to trust the key
used by [[https://hydra.nixos.org][Hydra]]:

#+begin_example
❯ grep trusted-public-keys /etc/nix/nix.conf
trusted-public-keys = cache.nixos.org-1:6NCHdD59X431o0gWypbMrAURkbJ16ZPMQFGspcDShjY=
#+end_example

It's possible to have ~nix~ sign all store paths that are built locally using a
given private key. This can be done by adding the private key to
~/etc/nix/nix.conf~:

#+begin_example
secret-key-files <path-to-key>.pem
#+end_example

It's also possible to sign all existing store paths after the fact:

#+begin_example
$ nix store sign --all --key-file cache-priv-key.pem
#+end_example

Instead of explicitly signing store paths on the local machine it's possible
(and perhaps preferable) to sign the store paths when they are served through
servers like ~nix-serve~. In which case you shouldn't invoke the command above
or add the ~secret-key-files~ to ~/etc/nix/nix.conf~.

[fn:3]  Not really legacy, but I've been using the ~nix~ command for so long
it's starting to feel a lot like it.

** 🚀 ~deploy-rs~

I haven't been doing much of my own ~nix~ caching outside of simple experiments
and using the [[https://github.com/cachix/cachix-action][cachix-action]] in GitHub workflows. The tool I chose to use for
this was [[https://github.com/serokell/deploy-rs][deploy-rs]]. It allows checking, building and deploying ~NixOS~
configurations to remote systems while also having some nice bells and whistles
like automatic rollback on failure.

#+begin_src nix
{
  description = "NixOS Raspberry Pi configuration flake";

  inputs = {
    # Add deploy-rs as Flake input from GitHub
    deploy-rs.url = "github:serokell/deploy-rs";
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-22.05";
  };

  outputs = { self, deploy-rs, nixpkgs }: {
    nixosConfigurations.rpi = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      system = "aarch64-linux";
      modules = [
        # NixOS config
        # ...
      ];
    };

    # deploy-rs node configuration
    deploy.nodes.rpi = {
      hostname = "192.168.1.7";
      profiles.system = {
        sshUser = "myme";
        sshOpts = [ "-t" ];
        magicRollback = false;
        path =
          deploy-rs.lib.aarch64-linux.activate.nixos
            self.nixosConfigurations.rpi;
        user = "root";
      };
    };
  };
}
#+end_src

#+begin_note
I currently have disabled the ~magicRollback~ and require some additional ~ssh~
options in order for ~sudo~ to work well remotely on the R-Pi. There might be
ways around this, but I haven't really spent much time on it.
#+end_note

Once the ~deploy-rs~ configuration is in place the time has come for testing our
first remote deployment. First we need to tell ~deploy-rs~ about our cache key
before we can start the actual deploy step. This is just defining a ~LOCAL_KEY~
environment variable. Then running ~deploy~ with either zero arguments (defaults
to all defined nodes) or with a ~flake~ path to a specific node:

#+begin_example
$ export LOCAL_KEY=/var/nix/cache-priv-key.pem
$ deploy .#rpi
#+end_example

[[file:../images/nixos-raspberry-pi3-deploy-rs.png]]

** For generations to come!

Once the ~deploy-rs~ deployment succeeds it's possible to list the NixOS
generations on the R-Pi to see that we're indeed able to activate new
generations remotely.

[[file:../images/nixos-raspberry-pi3-generations.png]]

#+begin_note
See how the first generation running directly from the built SD image is from
~POSIX~ epoch.
#+end_note

* Rounding off

So, what did we do?

 1. Configured our build host to emulate ~aarch64~ for building binaries for the
    Raspberry Pi.
 2. Added our ~NixOS~ customizations to the minimal Raspberry Pi SD card
    configuration.
 3. Built the SD card image and copied it over to a physical card.
 4. Booted the Raspberry Pi (with sufficient power) into a batteries included
    ~NixOS~ installation.
 5. Set up our build machine with a ~nix store~ cache key.
 6. Configured ~deploy-rs~ with our Raspberry Pi as a node.
 7. Successfully deployed ~NixOS~ to the Raspberry Pi 🚀

There are probably tons of things I can improve with this process, but at least
it's at the point where this is working smoothly.

Now I just need to find something to use this aging R-Pi for!
