It has been my intention for a long time to setup a static home page where I can
publish articles and share thoughts. Unfortunately I haven't prioritized this
high enough and so it has taken me a lot longer than what I would have liked.

I've been shopping around for static site generators, briefly trying out
=JavaScript= and =NodeJS= based options before finally settling on [[https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/][Hakyll]]. The
main motivation for this is that I have a fondness for functional programming
and always liked Haskell. Alas, I have not been able to use it for work and
neither that much for personal projects. The only way to get better at Haskell
and purely functional programming is to use purely functional languages, so this
is a start.

Last Christmas, (I gave you my heart...) I decided to spend the holiday trying
out something new. At the time I stumbled onto some =YouTube= videos and blog
posts about [[http://spacemacs.org/][Spacemacs]], so I decided to give it a try. It's been almost a year
now, and I have not looked back. Being a long-time =vim= user I did get
comfortable rather quickly, yet I did not immediately miss anything crucial. Why
am I telling you this! Well, Hakyll uses [[http://pandoc.org/][Pandoc]] to render all kinds of markup
formats, and I couldn't be an =Emacs= user without falling for =org-mode=.
Writing =org-mode= in =Emacs= is far superior to using e.g. =Markdown=.

I don't have very large expectations of putting out article after article in a
regular fashion, but hopefully I'll get some sporadic inspirations motivating me
to write about it.
